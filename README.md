# Assignment 4: Magazine-Quiz
Your goal is to write your own Magazine Quiz using Python.

You can pick any topic you’d like, write your own questions, and score them however you want!

Some Examples of topics include:
- video games / game consoles
- musicians / artists / streamers
- books / manga / bloggers / influencers
- movies / shows / anime
- cars / trucks / planes / trains
- electronics / PCs / laptops
- sports / competitions

Here’s a checklist of the minimum requirements for your program:
- Must be a program that asks the user 10 questions about a topic of your choice.
- Must use a function for each question (returning the score earned by that question)
- Must have a title before any questions are asked
- Each question must have four possible answers.
- The correct answer should be worth more than all the others.
- The wrong answer(s) should be worth the least.
- Must calculate the total after all questions are answered.
- Must show the user their total.
- Must have 3 ranges for the total score that match up with 3 different descriptions (just like the “Buffy” quiz shown above). Each description should have its own name (like -“Buffy Fan”, “Buffy Fanatic”, and “Buff Daddy”).
- Your program must use a function to display the description

Here’s a list of extra features that you can include only if your program meets the minimum requirements shown above and you have the time to implement them:
- Before the quiz starts, ask the user for their name so you can customize the description they get when the quiz is over.
For example, if the user’s name is Ryder, the “Buffy Fan” description might start with ‘Ryder, you’re definitely into Buffy, but it’s not like…’
- Have more than 3 ranges for the total score so users can get more specific descriptions of how well they know the topic.
- Have special messages for users that get the lowest possible score (be nice) and the highest possible score.
- Make the quiz harder by including a few questions that don’t just ask the user to answer “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.
For example, for the question ‘How many episodes did Angel appear in?’ you could ask the user for an integer and award them points depending on how close they were to the answer (it’s 58).
- If the user scores perfect, give them a bonus question that’s super difficult to answer. If they get it right, show them an extra special message letting them know that they’re amazing!
- If the user gets the bonus question wrong, give them another question that’s a bit easier so they can still feel good when the quiz is over.
- Include some ASCII art either before the quiz starts or after it ends.
- Find some creative way to allow two users to take the quiz at the same time without each other knowing what the other picked as their answer.
- Find some way of timing the quiz so the user knows how long it took them to answer all 10 questions.

Practice reusing functions by allowing the user to try an individual question again if they do not get a correct answer the first time.
